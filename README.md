You have to make a website with three pages (components)

- Profile - there should an image of the user, under which there will be a box with his/ her details in it. His/ her posts under the details or in a separate tab.

- Posts - A listing of fake posts (block type), with a fake image, name and the post title, description

- Messages - a box with some fake messages. Right and left align according to sender/ receiver. And when you type a message and hit enter, the message should get displayed in real time.

Pointers:

- The three pages should be independent components

- You can use the post component in the profile component

- The individual components have their own routes

- The code should be well structured keeping scalability in mind

- You can any CSS framework you wish

- There should be a nav bar to navigate between pages

- The design doesn't matter (for this test project), the structure, scalability, cleanliness and the execution of the code does.
